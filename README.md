# JapanScratchersFes 2022
[Japanese edition](Japanese.md)

## Overview
JapanScratchersFes is an unofficial event held by Japanese Scratchers on a voluntary basis, separate from the events held by the official Scratch management team.

## Reason for the event
The inspiration for this event came from a Scratcher's tweet.
"I want to gather Scratchers and have an offline meeting."
A lot of people responded to this tweet, and the idea was put into action.

## Current situation
The event is scheduled to be held around next summer vacation!
We have decided to hold a memorial programming contest.
The first test event will be held soon.
